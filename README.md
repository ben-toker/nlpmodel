# Classification and Sentiment Analysis model 
***
This project involves the implementation of transformer models made available through the fastai and Hugging Face transformers libraries. We wanted to train a model that will take in a coherent passage and return the subject of the passage and its average connotation (a number bounded between -1 and 1).  We achieved this through text categorization datasets and sentiment classification. This collaborative project also served as an introduction to a wide variety of ML and NLP topics.

## Installation and Setup
***
Python is the main language used in this project. To install the required dependencies use pip as shown below.
```
$ cd nlpmodel
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the trained models, you will need to download them from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CwxtrDH2olbzOznYaLuzfGEmLP26scT_?usp=sharing), as GitHub cannot store these large files here. 

## Classification Setup
Download the "*Classification_Model*" folder from the google drive and place it inside the repository folder. 
Now run the *classifyinput.py* script. Now you can demo any input you want!
